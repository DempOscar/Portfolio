# Create React App

This is a [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) starter that uses [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/).

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/6sjhSn?referralCode=ySCnWl)

## ‚ú® Features

- Create React App
- [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)

## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to use

- Install required dependencies with `npm install`
- Start the server for development `npm run dev`

  (The original `start` command has been more appropriately renamed to `dev`)

## ‚ùì Why use `Caddy` when deploying to Railway?

Caddy is a powerful, enterprise-ready, open source web server, and therefore Caddy is far better suited to serve websites than react-scripts is, using Caddy will result in much less memory and cpu usage compared to serving with react-scripts (much lower running costs too)

To see how this is achieved with nixpacks, check out the fully documented nixpacks.toml file in this repository

The configuration for Caddy is called a Caddyfile, and you can edit that file to further suite your needs, by default it comes configured to serve a single page app for Vue 3, and to also gzip the responses
